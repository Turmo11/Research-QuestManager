## What we'll be talking about

My Research Project consists on how to implement a proper Quest Manager into a videogame using the SDL & STL libraries. In order to do so, we firstly need to understand what is a quest and what involves managing them. Therfore we will be talking about:

#### Quests Variation

- Simplicity: complexity of the quest's logic and systems involved

- Linearity: Multiple Solutions or linear quests

- Capacity: amount of quests

- Generation: Predefined quests or random

- Modularity: Grouping quests or Unique quests

#### Event System
- How do we track if quests are being completed or not

#### Data Driven quests
- How do we implement new quests in our game

#### How do we implement our own Quest Manager
- We'll be taking on a list of TODO's in order to hopefully acquire a simple example of a well functioning Quest Manager
